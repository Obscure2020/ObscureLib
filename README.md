# ObscureLib

This project is intended to serve as a drop-in provider of a family of utility functions that I've found useful, but have not found to be routinely pre-provided in the standard libraries of the languages I use.

You are free to take this code and paste it into any of your own projects. If it's useful to me, it might be useful to you too.

In this project's initial conception (circa May 2025), I'm writing the code in Java first and foremost. I plan to offer ports of the same functionality into other languages further down the line.
